# 3D Space Shooter with Unity DOTS

This is a work-in-progress **3D Space Shooter** game developed in **Unity** using the **Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS)**. The project is an ambitious attempt to leverage Unity DOTS for high-performance gameplay, building on the concepts explored in the 2D ECS version.

## Current Features

- **Player Movement**:
  - The player can control a spaceship using the keys **Z, Q, S, D**.
  - Smooth movement mechanics using Unity's ECS system for performance optimization.

- **Unity DOTS Integration**:
  - Utilizes Unity's **ECS**, **Jobs System**, and **Burst Compiler** for efficient handling of game entities and components.

## Planned Features

This project is not yet complete, and several key gameplay elements are still under development:

- **Enemy Logic**:
  - Add enemies that move dynamically and interact with the player.
  
- **Laser Mechanics**:
  - Implement shooting mechanics for the player and enemies.

- **Health and Scoring**:
  - Add health bars and a scoring system to track player performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Unity (version supporting DOTS, e.g., Unity 2022.x or higher).
- Knowledge of Unity DOTS and ECS architecture.

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DeepLeau/space-shooter-dots.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Unity.

3. Configure the DOTS packages if required.

4. Press **Play** in the Unity Editor to test the current player movement mechanics.

## Controls

- **Z**: Move forward.
- **Q**: Move left.
- **S**: Move backward.
- **D**: Move right.

## Acknowledgments

This project draws inspiration from the **Space Shooter ECS** project in Python with Pygame. The goal is to bring similar gameplay mechanics to a 3D environment while leveraging the power of Unity DOTS for scalability and performance.
